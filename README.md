# PY-MAZE-PROJECT


Project Overview
The Optimal Pathfinder is a versatile tool designed to solve and visualize maze puzzles using the A pathfinding algorithm*. This project focuses on achieving efficient performance and accurate results in navigating from a starting point to a goal within a customizable maze environment. The A* algorithm, combining aspects of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search, ensures both optimal pathfinding and efficient search execution.

Key Features

A Algorithm Implementation*:
At the heart of the tool is the A* algorithm, which employs a heuristic to guide its search towards the goal. It balances exploring new potential paths and optimizing known paths to minimize the total estimated cost, ensuring both effectiveness and efficiency in solving mazes.

Optimized Data Structures:
The project uses advanced data structures to enhance algorithm performance, including:

Priority Queue: Allows efficient selection of nodes with the lowest cost, crucial for A*'s functionality.
Deque: Manages open and closed sets of nodes, facilitating quick addition and removal during the search process.
Dynamic and Customizable Visualization:
Using the PyMaze library, the tool provides interactive and dynamic visualizations of the A* pathfinding process. Multiple agents can be used to highlight different paths, such as the search path, the explored path, and the final shortest path. The maze size, layout, and agent paths can be customized for a variety of configurations, offering a clear representation of the algorithm in action.

User Interaction:
Users can input custom mazes and visualize how the A* algorithm navigates through them in real-time. The tool dynamically adjusts to different maze sizes and configurations, offering a deeper understanding of the algorithm's mechanics and performance.

Technical Specifications

Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used:
